# HurtChain
HurtChain is a platform for posting wholesale product sale listings for **any entrepreneur**. 
With its help, all interested parties can learn the most important information about the sold items and get contact information to the advertiser.

## Available Features
- Browse listings (no account creation required)
	- List view and grid view are available
	- In the details of each listing, **contact information of the entrepreneur is clearly displayed** allowing for easy contact in case of purchase intent. In future versions of the service, we plan to add a chat feature, which will further increase user convenience and their security through the use of blockchain technology.
	- Category division allows for convenient finding of searched listings
	- In future versions, the ability to freely search listings will also be added, as well as sorting and filtering according to various criteria
- Account creation
	- Account is required to create listings and post reviews
	- The "profile" tab allows entering personal data, which is then displayed with each listing. In the future, it will also be possible to post your profile picture and more information about the company (description, location, average rating of all listings).
- Adding and managing listings
	- Listing editing is not available in the current **prototype** version of the application, but will be added in the near future
- Browsing and posting reviews under other people's listings, including transparent display of the average rating of each product
- Favorites: user has the ability to save listings that interest them so they can have easy access to them in the future.

## Application Design
HurtChain has a beautiful modern interface that allows for convenient navigation through the service. Additionally, the application was immediately designed by us in dark mode - no service with similar purpose has such functionality. The use of CSS variables allows for simple implementation of light mode in the future.
